## Features

- Syntax Highlighting (**incomplete**): Syntax highlighting for Omniarium, Omniarium Layers, and
Omniarium Regex.
This makes code easier to read and understand.

- Snippets (**incomplete**): Speed up your development with built-in snippets for common Omniarium
and Omniarium Layers constructs. Just type the prefix and press Tab to insert the code.

- Basic Formatting (**incomplete**): Automatically format your code to adhere to consistent style
guidelines.

- File Associations: Automatically associate `.omni`, `.omni.lyr`, `.omni.loc`, `.omni.ini`,
and `.omni.manifest` files with the Omniarium language mode.
